I've built a trainer-helper app, which lets you view different fitnessclasses. It's built in ReactJS.

For styling I've used mainly TailwindCSS, which is CSS framework that lets you give elements classnames to style them.

API fetching is done through axios due to my own likeness to it, as i think it makes handling APIS easier.

All components with sliding functionality, are done through sliderJS, a package which comes with a library of different, easy to change, sliders.

Validation of text fields are done through yup and react-hook-forms.

## Extra assignment:

My site is hosted on netlify with automatic building/publishing through any changes to the master branch on this github page.
